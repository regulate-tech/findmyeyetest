# Specify the GitHub Pages gem to use the same dependencies as the server
# This gem includes Jekyll and all supported plugins at specific versions.
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have custom, supported plugins, list them here:
# group :jekyll_plugins do
#   gem "jekyll-sitemap" # Already included in github-pages, but for example
# end

# Optional: To ensure the correct Ruby version is used locally (highly recommended)
# You would also create a file named .ruby-version with the number (e.g., 3.2.2)
# ruby "3.2.2" 

# Optional: For Windows users to improve file watching performance
